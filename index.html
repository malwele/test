<h1 title="This Page is written by Josiah Kunda" id="home_title">Zambia Postal code system</h1>
<pre id="formatted">
  Zambia is a country in Africa with a population of about 18 million. Landlocked with no harbors can only money through in-land
  activities. 
      Awhile back zambia had a <a href="#dummy">postal service</a> 10101 but it doesnt and this hinds its growth and development
  and connection to the outside world. Not only that its people have no way to send these via mail but through extensive effort.
  <img src="#some-image" alt="Zambia" width=120px height=200px>
      My goal is to create a postal system for the country and develop it from the roots. I plan to do this is two years time.
  Through your help we can make zambia a better place.
